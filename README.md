# locationDemoApp-Swift
It gives you elapsed time between locationManager's init and fetch coordinates.

You can open your WiFi to enhance coordinate accuracy. (Even connection is not needed to handle coordinates only, but not in airplane mode) Because WiFi access points which are around you help it find by triangulation. But for next step, (handling address datas) the connection is needed. This demo app gives you elapsed time just for first step, not for second (address).
